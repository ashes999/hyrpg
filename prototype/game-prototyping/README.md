# Game Prototyping
A collection of stuff that aids in game prototyping. Fast, cheap, grey-boxed!

If you add this as a submodule, add this as the first bit of Javascript under `<head>`:

`<script>window.prototypePath = "<path to game-prototyping folder>/";</script>`

This will initialize all files/etc. correctly. The trailing slash is important!
